# Image Gradients and Edge Detection

# Compute the Laplacian of the image -
#We use a 64bit float due to the negative slope induced by transforming the image from white-to-black. 
#{Black-to-White transition is taken as Positive slope while White-to-Black transition as Negative slope}
#So when you convert data to np.uint8, all negative slopes are made zero. In simple words, you miss some edges.
#If you want to detect all edges, better option is to keep the output datatype to some higher forms, like cv2.CV_16S, cv2.CV_64F etc, 
#take its absolute value and then convert back to cv2.CV_8U or np.uint8
#A 64bit float supports the negative numbers weâ€™ll be dealing with when the Laplacian method is run

# The sobelX and sobelY images are now of the floating point data type -- we need to take care when converting
# back to an 8-bit unsigned integer that we do not miss any images due to clipping values outside the range
# of [0, 255]. First, we take the absolute value of the gradient magnitude images, THEN we convert them back
# to 8-bit unsigned integers
